# ADT-Stack-Using-Singly-Linked-List
This program implements basic stack ADT operations using a singly linked list. This functions in a similar manner as if you were to make a stack of plates. In this scenario, adding or removing is only possible at the top.

The main() function gives the user a choice on whether they want to PUSH, POP, or DISPLAY the stack. The proper fucntion is called here using switch. Similarly, if the user enters an invalid choice, then it is made known to the user. There is also an option to EXIT the progam.
